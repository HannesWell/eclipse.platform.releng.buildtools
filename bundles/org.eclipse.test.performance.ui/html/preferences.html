<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>
The tool have some preferences which may be configured by advanced users.
This must be done carefully otherwise, either no data could be read by the tool
and/or generatead results could be puzzled.
</p><p>

<h3>Eclipse version</h3>
<p><img src="images/preferences-eclipse-versions.png" alt="Preferences Eclipse versions"/></p>
<p>
The Eclipse version on which the performance results belongs to. There are
only two possible choice: the maintenance and the current versions.
</p>

<h3>Database</h3>
<p><img src="images/preferences-database.png" alt="Preferences Database"/></p>
<p>
By default the tool does not connect to any performance results database as common
users might not have enough rights to access it. However, users having these
rights may want to look at the database contents and update the local data files
with it. Hence, it is possible to configure the tool to connect to a database
which may be either local or on the releng server (<code><b>minsky</b></code>).
</p><p>
Note that the folder for the local database must be the parent of the
<code>perfDb3x</code> folder otherwise you'll get an error message.
</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p><img src="images/preferences-milestones.png" alt="Preferences Milestones"/></p>
<p>
TODO</p>

<h3>Milestones</h3>
<p><img src="images/preferences-milestones.png" alt="Preferences Milestones"/></p>
<p>
These are the list of the version milestones. Each milestone is a date string
using the <b>yyyymmddHHMM</b> format. When a new milestone is shipped, then a new
date must be added to this preference to let the tool to identify it in the builds
list and emphasize it...
</p>

<h3>Last build</h3>
<p><img src="images/preferences-lastbuild.png" alt="Preferences Last build"/></p>
<p>
The last build on which verifications and/or generation want to be done.
All builds after the selected one are ignored by the tool likewise they would
have no local data. Changing this value will trigger the initialization of
the local data which will be read again.
</p>

<h2>Default dimension</h2>
<p><img src="images/preferences-default-dim.png" alt="Preferences Default dimension"/></p>
<p>
This is the dimension used to compute delta and make the verification. Currently
this is the <b>Elapsed Process Time</b> dimension.
</p><p>
<i>Note that the default dimension must belong to the <b>Results dimensions</b>
described below, hence a new selected dimensions will always be automatically
added to the list...</i>
</p>

<h2>Results dimensions</h2>
<p><img src="images/preferences-results-dim.png" alt="Preferences Results dimension"/></p>
<p>
These are dimensions displayed in the scenario data HTML pages. Currently there
are the <b>Elapsed Process Time</b> and the <b>CPU Time</b>. Having these dimensions
configurable may be interesting to display others dimensions and see whether their
numbers may be relevant or not (e.g. <b>Used Hava Heap</b>).
</p><p>
<i>Note that the default dimension described above must belong to the selected
dimensions, hence it will always be automatically added to the new selected list...</i>
