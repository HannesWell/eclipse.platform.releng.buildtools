1.  the eclipse.perf.config setting used to run tests include three key value pairs:  config, build and jvm (for example,
"eclipse.perf.config=config=relengbuildwin2;build=I20050219-1500;jvm=sun1.4.2_06").
2.  the value for the "build" key begins with either an 'I' or 'N'.


The program expects the following arguments:


-baseline
	Build id against which to compare results.
	Same as value specified for the "build" key in the eclipse.perf.config system property.

-current
build id for which to generate results. Compared to build id specified in -baseline parameter above.
Same as value specified for the "build" key in the eclipse.perf.config system property. 

-jvm
Value specified in "jvm" key in eclipse.perf.config system property for current build.

-config
Comma separated list of config names for which to generate results.
Same as values specified in "config" key in eclipse.perf.config system property.

-output 
Path to default output directory.

[-config.properties]
Optional. Used by scenario status table to provide the following:
alternate descriptions of config values to use in columns.
url for hyperlinks from status icons for a scenario in each row.
Can also provide an optional output directory for raw data tables and line graphs for the config.
The value should be specified in the following format:
name1,description1,url1 [,outputdir1];name2,description2,url2 [,outputdir2];etc..

[-highlight.latest]
Optional. Comma-separated list of build Id prefixes used to find most recent matching for each entry.
Result used to highlight points in line graphs.

[-scenario.pattern]
Optional. Scenario prefix pattern to query database. If not specified,
default of % used in query.

[-fingerprints]
Optional. Use to generate fingerprints only.

[-scenarioresults]
Generates table of scenario reference and current data with line graphs.
